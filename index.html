                Hello, My name is Ana Michelle Pineda. I am 29 years old. I was born in Veracruz, Mexico. I've lived in
                many
                cool places such as Mexico City, Cabo San Lucas, Barcelona, Czech Republic, and since 2014 I've lived in
                Irvine, Orange, Costa Mesa, Palm Desert and currently Huntington Beach.</p>
            <p class="text"> My dad is Mexican and my mom is American. They live in Mexico with their dog,
                Milly
                and their 5 cats. My brother is 31 years old and lives in Alexandria, Virginia and is looking to move to
                Colorado soon. Laura, my sister, is 26 and currently going to school to become a physical therapist. My
                cat
                Penny has been my little bestie for 3 years now. I think bestie is said loosely, we are frenemies too, I
                don't think I've ever forgiven anyone for making me bleed so much. </p>
            <p class="textTwo">I am currently a Sales Manager at Marriott. I've been an event planner and sales manager
                for
                about 5 years now, but decided to shake things up by taking this course. Currently having a lot of fun
                learning and enjoying the rush of solving a difficult puzzle. Although doing this homework I've been
                thinkin coding consists of an elaborate combination of feelings. I can go from neutral to wanting to
                throw my laptop, to extreme excitement, to crashing wanting to take a nap, possibly all within an hour.
                But I like it, I'm having fun doing this. I

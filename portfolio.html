            Hello, My name is Ana Michelle Pineda. I am 29 years old. I was born in Veracruz, Mexico. I've lived in many
            cool places such as Mexico City, Cabo San Lucas, Barcelona, Czech Republic, and since 2014 I've lived in
            Irvine, Orange, Costa Mesa, Palm Desert and currently Huntington Beach.</p>
        <p class="textOnePointOne"> My dad is Mexican and my mom is American. They live in Mexico with their dog, Milly
            and their 5 cats. My brother is 31 years old and lives in Alexandria, Virginia and is looking to move to
            Colorado soon. Laura, my sister, is 26 and currently going to school to become a physical therapist. My cat
            Penny has been my little bestie for 3 years now.</p>
        <p class="textTwo">I am currently a Sales Manager at Marriott. I've been an event planner and sales manager for
            about 5 years now, but decided to shake things up by taking this course. Currently having a lot of fun
            learning and enjoying the rush of solving a difficult puzzle.
